# Gold Rate Email Notifier

Gold Rate Email Notifier is a Python application that retrieves the latest gold and silver prices using the [MetalPriceAPI](https://metalpriceapi.com/), saves daily prices to a CSV file, and sends a formatted email report to specified recipients using Gmail SMTP.

## Features

- Fetches current gold (24k, 22k, 18k) and silver (per gram, per kg) prices in INR.
- Automatically saves the rates to a CSV file for logging.
- Sends a daily summary email with prices to your chosen recipient.
- Customizable email sender and recipient details.
- Environment variable-based configuration for security and flexibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- [MetalPriceAPI](https://metalpriceapi.com/) account and API key
- Gmail account and an **app password** (required if using 2-step verification)
- The following Python packages:
    - `requests`
    - `python-dotenv`

    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```

3. **Set up your `.env` file in the project root:**

    EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
    SENDER_NAME=Your Name

4. **Usage**

    This will fetch rates, append a record to `rates.csv`, and send the summary email.

## Notes

- If you encounter SMTP or login errors, ensure your Gmail account allows [less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en) or use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).
- Daily price logging is enabled in `rates.csv` which will grow over time as a record.
- For automation (e.g., daily cron job), simply schedule the script to run once per day.
